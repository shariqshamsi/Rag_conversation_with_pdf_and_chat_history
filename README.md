# Rag_conversation_with_pdf_and_chat_history
 This repository provides a Streamlit-based interface for performing conversational retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) on PDF documents. Users can upload PDF files, ask questions about their content, and interact with the data through a chat interface. The project incorporates chat history for a more context-aware conversational experience.
